#Memory management in C language
Overview
This project demonstrates the basics of memory management in C using dynamic memory allocation functions such as malloc, realloc, and free. These functions allow the programmer to allocate, reallocate, and deallocate memory during the runtime of a program, enabling more efficient and flexible memory usage.
